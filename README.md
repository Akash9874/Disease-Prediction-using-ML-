Genomic Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning and Flask

This repository contains a web-based application for predicting diseases based on genomic data. The project leverages machine learning for making predictions and utilizes Flask, HTML, and CSS to create an interactive and user-friendly web interface.

Features

Machine Learning Integration: A robust machine learning model is used to analyze genomic data and predict potential diseases.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Flask, HTML, and CSS for seamless user interaction.

File Upload Capability: Users can upload genomic data files (e.g., FASTA or CSV) for analysis.

Interactive Output: Disease predictions are displayed clearly on the web page.

Technologies Used

Backend: Flask (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Machine Learning: TensorFlow
